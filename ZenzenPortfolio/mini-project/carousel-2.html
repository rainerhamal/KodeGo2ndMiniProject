            <p>There are a couple of sports anime series that have North American disc releases scheduled in coming months: Slam Dunk on May 12th and Haikyu!! on June 2nd.</p><br>
            <p>Cinedigm’s first Slam Dunk DVD set was originally scheduled to come out last December but that month passed with no updates about a revised date until recently when the current May date appeared on Rightstuf and other retail sites. The set is listed with 14 episodes and English & Japanese language tracks; the English dub to be included is suspected to be the same as what was previously released in the mid-2000’s by Toei.</p><br>
            <p>The first subtitled-only DVD and Blu-ray collections for Haikyu!! were included in Sentai Filmworks’ June 2015 releases announcement in late Februrary and will have the first 13 episodes of season 1. The other season 1 set would presumably have the remaining 12 episodes (14 through 25). A second season of the high school volleyball series has been green-lit.</p><br>
